## ✨ Features

- Encodes emotional reflex and internal state (`LX:` / `LXp:`)
- Symbolic + physical gesture layering (e.g., `ri+pb`)
- Ethical logic via **LexEthics** (`LXd:` danger/caution modes)
- Perceptual tagging with **LexSense** (facial, tone, posture analysis)
- Situational awareness and environment-based interpretation with **LexContext** (e.g., time of day, social setting, urgency)
- Collective emotional feedback or consensus modeling across multiple agents or users **LexCrowd** (ideal for swarm intelligence or crowd sentiment).
- Tries to resolve between **surface expression** and **underlying intention**
